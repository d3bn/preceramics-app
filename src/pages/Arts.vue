              <p class="line-clamp-4">I approach clay as both a vessel of memory and a living language-one that speaks
                through form, texture, and fire. In these sculptures, I explore how folklore, personal expression, and
                traditional technique can intertwine in quiet, powerful dialogue.

              <p class="line-clamp-4">&mdash; Precious Grace</p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">As part of her apprenticeship at Kanayama Yaki, Filipino ceramic artist Precious Grace G. Parreño was
                invited to take part in an annual tradition: sculpting a Kappa-a water-dwelling yokai from Japanese
                folklore-paired with that year's zodiac animal. For 2024 and 2025, she created works inspired by the
                Dragon and the Snake, respectively.
              </p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">In place of a standard depiction, Parreño introduced a wholly original interpretation of the mythical
                Kappa. Her version is expressive, endearing, and full of personality, marked by wide, animated features
                and a dynamic pose that suggests both affection and playful chaos. These imaginative creatures quickly
                captured the attention of both studio visitors and the wider community.</p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">Her 2024 sculpture shows the Kappa embracing a dragon in a swirling, tender entanglement-reflecting the
                powerful and sometimes contradictory relationship between mischief and majesty. The piece is crafted
                from local Kanayama clay and wood-fired, giving it rich earth tones and natural ash textures that evoke
                both riverbed and myth.</p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">Parreño's interpretation resonated deeply-so much so that she was asked to create nearly a hundred
                versions of these original Kappa figures due to growing demand. Each variation carries the spirit of the
                original while celebrating subtle differences in gesture and character.</p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">In an especially poetic touch, Parreño's Kappas are designed with buoyancy in mind. True to their
                origin as water spirits or river gods in Japanese mythology, her ceramic Kappas are able to float when
                placed in water, a playful but reverent nod to their folklore roots.

              </p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">Her work was also featured on Apple Wide, a local television program in Aomori, Japan, after a regional
                reporter encountered her sculpture. The feature recognized her as an emerging artist whose work bridges
                cultural storytelling, material craft, and imaginative reinterpretation.
              </p>

              <p class="line-clamp-4">Now working on the Kappa for the Year of the Snake (2025), Parreño continues to explore how traditional
                mythology can be reawakened through clay-and how each figure can tell a new story in an old language.</p>
