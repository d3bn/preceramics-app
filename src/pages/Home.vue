      <p>Art has always been more than a profession for Precious Grace G. Parreño—it’s a way
        of
        connecting with the world, of translating the raw elements of life into something tangible.
        Born in the Philippines, Precious discovered her love for form, texture, and material while
        studying at the University of the Philippines. At that time, she stood alone as the only student
        majoring in Sculpture in her batch—a bold and unconventional path that marked the
        beginning of her lifelong dedication to clay.</p>
      <p>Initially drawn to sculpture for its expressive potential, she experimented with various materials before
        discovering ceramics. Clay offered a unique balance between control and chaos. It was pliable, intuitive, and
        responsive to her hands—yet required deep knowledge, patience, and respect to complete. “Making and thinking is
        one thing, but as you get deeper into ceramics, you realize that there are so many variables at play,” she
        reflects.

          From 2015 to 2025, Precious underwent a rigorous apprenticeship at Kanayama Pottery in Aomori Prefecture,
          Japan. Though the core apprenticeship lasted three years, the entire process stretched over a decade due to
          cultural, visa, and life transitions. Under the guidance of Ryoji Matsumia, the owner of the company and a
          master of Bizen-style wood firing, Precious developed her foundational skills. But it wasn’t only
          Matsumia-sensei who shaped her—she was immersed in a collaborative environment where the entire company staff
          contributed to her learning. Each artisan shared their own specialized knowledge and techniques, creating a
          rare opportunity for her to learn from multiple teachers with different perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>Working in a mass-production setting specializing in traditional Bizen-style ceramics, she was often
          challenged by repetitive tasks that tested her creativity and patience. Yet, through this repetition, she
          gained technical precision, mental discipline, and a deeper understanding of ceramic craftsmanship. When the
          time came and Matsumia-sensei gave her permission to create sculptural work, she returned to her conceptual
          art roots—infusing them with the skill and discipline honed over years of practice.</p>

          Precious is particularly drawn to Bizen-style wood firing for its raw, ancient, and unpredictable nature. Unlike glazed pottery, which often results in polished uniformity, Bizen ceramics forgo glaze entirely. Instead, they rely on flame, ash, and clay to create organic, unrepeatable patterns that emerge naturally from the kiln. This process reflects her values: embracing imperfection, honoring tradition, and allowing nature to shape the final form.
        </p>
        <p>What began as a love for food—and the idea of crafting her own plates—has evolved into a deeply personal practice rooted in sculpture. Today, her ceramic works explore identity, memory, and transformation, often taking form as expressive handbuilt pieces and self-portraits that connect her past and present.</p>
        <p>Now based in Japan, Precious continues to create ceramic sculptures that bridge cultures
and techniques. Her work is a quiet yet powerful celebration of process, resilience, and the
stories we carry in our hands.</p>
