        <div class="flex-shrink">Art has always been more than a profession for Precious Grace G. Parreño—it’s a way
          of
          connecting with the world, of translating the raw elements of life into something tangible.
          Born in the Philippines, Precious discovered her love for form, texture, and material while
          studying at the University of the Philippines. At that time, she stood alone as the only student
          majoring in Sculpture in her batch—a bold and unconventional path that marked the
          beginning of her lifelong dedication to clay.</div>

      <p>Initially drawn to sculpture for its expressive potential, she experimented with various
        materials before discovering ceramics. Clay offered a unique balance between control and
        chaos. It was pliable, intuitive, and responsive to her hands—yet required deep knowledge,
        patience, and respect to complete. “Making and thinking is one thing, but as you get deeper
        into ceramics, you realize that there are so many variables at play,” she reflects.</p>

        <div class="flex-shrink">While her formal training introduced her to American-style pottery—a standard in
          Philippine
          ceramics education—it laid the groundwork for her eventual deep dive into the traditional
          techniques of Japan. What began as curiosity evolved into a decade-long journey.</div>

      <p>
        From 2015 to 2025, Precious underwent a rigorous apprenticeship at Kanayama Pottery in
        Aomori Prefecture, Japan. Though the core apprenticeship lasted three years, the entire
        process stretched over a decade due to cultural, visa, and life transitions. Under the
        guidance of Ryoji Matsumia, the owner of the company and a master of Bizen-style wood
        firing, Precious developed her foundational skills. But it wasn’t only Matsumia-sensei who
        shaped her—she was immersed in a collaborative environment where the entire company
        staff contributed to her learning. Each artisan shared their own specialized knowledge and
        techniques, creating a rare opportunity for her to learn from multiple teachers with different
        perspectives.

      <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-5">
        <p>Working in a mass-production setting specializing in traditional Bizen-style ceramics, she
          was often challenged by repetitive tasks that tested her creativity and patience. Yet, through
          this repetition, she gained technical precision, mental discipline, and a deeper understanding
          of ceramic craftsmanship. When the time came and Matsumia-sensei gave her permission to
          create sculptural work, she returned to her conceptual art roots—infusing them with the skill
          and discipline honed over years of practice.</p>

      <p>Precious is particularly drawn to Bizen-style wood firing for its raw, ancient, and
        unpredictable nature. Unlike glazed pottery, which often results in polished uniformity, Bizen
        ceramics forgo glaze entirely. Instead, they rely on flame, ash, and clay to create organic,
        unrepeatable patterns that emerge naturally from the kiln. This process reflects her values:
        embracing imperfection, honoring tradition, and allowing nature to shape the final form.</p>

        <p>What began as a love for food—and the idea of crafting her own plates—has evolved into a
          deeply personal practice rooted in sculpture. Today, her ceramic works explore identity,
          memory, and transformation, often taking form as expressive handbuilt pieces and
          self-portraits that connect her past and present.</p>
